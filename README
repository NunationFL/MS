To run the simulation pypy3 is recommended, python3 may also work but run considerably slower.

Copy folders inside [folder](https://we.tl/t-7Mi8cGfUqk) to the root of the project with the folowing tree:

	root-
		files/
		dataset/
		src/
		
		
Navigate
		
		
To run the setup parts of the system delete the contents of dataset/ and files/ and then run ```make```. 
This is not recommendend as the full make may take over 2 hours and consume over 13GiB of memory.

If ```make``` is run without deleting the files, the expensive steps will be ignored.
The setup part of the system only works on Linux 64bit System (tested in Ubuntu 22.04) as parts of the setup (Distance matrix and API) depend on a compiled version of the algorithm made in Go, as python proved to be too slow for the task.
